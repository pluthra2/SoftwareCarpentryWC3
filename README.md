## Explore My Netflix Watchlist

 All alone on a Friday night. Don't worry if you have Netflix (if you don't just get your friend's username and password) and the correct watchlist depending upon you mood (which is this), you are good to go to enjoy the evening in your PJs and in a land far far away!! 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/pluthra2/SoftwareCarpentryWC3/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
